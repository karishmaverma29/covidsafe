            <h3>wash your place</h3>
            <p>Cleaning with a household cleaner that contains soap or detergent reduces the amount of 
                germs on surfaces and decreases risk of infection from surfaces. In most situations,
                 cleaning alone removes most virus particles on surfaces. Disinfection to reduce transmission
                  of COVID-19 at home is likely not needed unless someone in your home is sick or if someone 
                  who is positive for COVID-19 has been in your home within the last 24 hours.</p>

            <h3>maintain distance</h3>

                Inside your home: Avoid close contact with people who are sick, if
                 possible. If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other
                  household members. If you are taking care of someone who is sick, make sure you
                   properly wear a well-fitting mask and follow other steps to protect yourself.
                Indoors in public: If you are not up to date on COVID-19 vaccines, stay at least
                 6 feet away from other people, especially if you are at higher risk of getting very sick with COVID-19.</p>

                To help prevent infections, keep your hands away from your eyes, nose, and mouth especially during the
                 COVID-19 pandemic. Why? These mucous membranes are a portal of entry for germs that cause respiratory infections, 
                including COVID-19.
                
                Why is not touching your face so important?
                It is estimated that people touch their face about 23 times per hour! Respiratory 
                infections can be caused by many different bacteria and viruses, including the virus that
                 causes COVID-19. When you touch your face, the germs on your hands can take up residence in your
                  mucous membranes and cause infections, including COVID-19 infections.</p>

            <h3>wash your hand</h3>
            <p>Why it’s important to wash your hands
                Like it or not, germs are everywhere and a part of our everyday life. Handwashing is one of the
                 best actions you can take to stop the spread of respiratory and diarrheal infections and avoid getting sick.
                
                Germs can easily spread when you touch your nose, mouth or eyes with an unwashed hand. They
                 can also spread when food and drinks are prepared by someone who didn’t wash their hands. 
                 When you cough or sneeze into your hand, 
                then touch another person’s hand or a common surface, you are spreading many germs. </p>

            <h3>use napkin</h3>
            <p>Help women in need to have a hygienic menstrual cycle
                Only 36% of India’s 336 million menstruating women use sanitary napkins.
                 And with the Covid-19 crisis, this number has gone down rapidly.
                
                Menstrual hygiene has been forced to take a backseat during the times of Covid-19.
                 Struggling to get even one meal a day, many women have gone back to practices of using 
                 ash and hay covered in rags during their period. Plus, adolescent girls from poor backgrounds have lost access to pads supplied to them in school, which have been shut since the first lockdown was imposed.
                
                This puts women and girls at risk of contracting cervical cancer, Hepatitis B and various 
                infections of the reproductive and urinary tracts, to name a few.</p>

            <h3>wear a mask</h3>
            <p>Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to suppress transmission and save lives; the use of a mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection against COVID-19.

                If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions,
                 such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds,
                  cleaning your hands, and coughing into a
                 bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!</p>

                    <p>01/11Do not panic!

                        The coronavirus pandemic has taken everybody by alarm. The internet is filled with information about the virus and its spread, many of it also wrong, causing panic among the people. While we all know the basic precautions to be taken to save yourself from being infected, here is a list of 10 things you should not do to save the infection and panic about the disease from escalating further.
                        
                        02/11Do not touch your face
                        
                        Medical advisories from the World Health Organisation (WHO) has reminded us time and again not to touch our face, nose and mouth too often. This helps reduce the chances of catching the virus as infection from your hands do not reach the nose or mouth from where it can infect the body. Keeping your hands clean will also help reduce the chances of the infection spreading any further.
                        
                        03/11Do not stockpile on masks
                        
                        It has been declared by the WHO, masks are not the most effective way of stopping the spread of the disease. They should only be worn by people who have been affected by the COVID-19, people who are taking care of patients. Wearing masks if you are healthy does not give you any extra protection from the virus. With everyone stocking on masks, the market is facing a major crunch which means there are a lesser number of masks available for people who really need them. It is advisable to stop using and piling on masks if you are not sick.
                        
                        
                        
                        04/11Do not travel unless necessary
                        
                        The airports and airplanes are where you are most likely to catch an infection. It Is advisable not to travel unless absolutely necessary. If you are travelling, you should take the required precautions and get yourself screened on landing. It is important you inform the airport and airline staff of you begin to feel sick while travelling.
                        
                        05/11Do not go to crowded places
                        
                        Public transport, metros, gyms and any other crowded place should be avoided. The more the number of people, the more likely of the spread of the virus. If you have symptoms, self-quarantine yourself other than to visit the doctor. Staying isolated and not coming in contact with a lot of people is the only way to contain the spread of the disease.
                        
                        
                        
                        06/11Do not believe everything on the internet
                        
                        The internet is filled with information about the symptoms and 
                        cure available for coronavirus. Do not believe anything unless
                         it comes from a reliable source or a reliable medical practitioner.
                          Spreading false information and promises about the cure for the disease 
                          has added to the panic and kept a large percentage of the population 
                          misinformed. Advertisements about health kits and alternative ways to
                           cure the infection are also doing the rounds of the internet. Do not 
                           fall into the trap yourself or propagate any information that is not from a reliable source.
                        
                        07/11Do not seek alternative treatments
                        
                        If you feel you have contracted the virus, do not seek any treatments other
                         than the ones advised by your doctor. Alternative treatments have not been 
                         found to be effective to treat the virus. It is advisable that you only follow the advice of your doctor. If you are infected and do not seek correct medical attention you pose as a threat to all the people around you. It is important for containing the spread of the disease that everyone consult a reliable medical practitioner on the treatments available.</p>
